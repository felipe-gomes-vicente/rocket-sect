### üíª Rocket Sect

The challenge of this one is to build a web page from scratch using the layout of 
the prototype available on figma, strengthen my knowledge of HTML and CSS in applying 
concepts and what was seen in previous Stage 2 projects.
I went further and challenged myself to apply concepts that were not observed in 
classes and projects when applying responsiveness on the web page.

What was developed:

- Structuring HTML with semantic tags;
- I challenged myself and applied Responsiveness;
- Position of elements on the screen;
- Import external CSS file into the project;
- Applying custom fonts (typography) in the CSS file and starting the external CSS;
- Working with colors and fonts;
- Aligning and positioning texts and elements;
- Applying the spacing;
- Borders and element classifications;
- The CSS Box Model concept;
- Use CSS variables to manipulate the project's color palette;
- Hover effect on HTML elements of links;
- Reset CSS removing possible inconsistencies between different browsers;
- Project file system structure separated by folder;


I applied my knowledge of the Explorer from Rocketseat concepts in a practical way 
to this project, with the lessons:

- Introduction to HTML and CSS;
- Getting to know new concepts of HTML and CSS;
